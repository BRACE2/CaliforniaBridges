  abstract = {Several recorded motions for seven bridge systems in California during recent earthquakes were analysed using parametric and non-parametric system identification (SI) methods. The bridges were selected considering the availability of an adequate array of accelerometers and accounting for different structural systems, materials, geometry and soil types. The results of the application of SI methods included identification of modal frequencies and damping ratios. Excellent fits of the recorded motion in the time domain were obtained using parametric methods. The multi-input/single-output SI method was a suitable approach considering the instrumentation layout for these bridges. Use of the constructed linear filters for prediction purposes was also demonstrated for three bridge systems. Reasonable prediction results were obtained considering the various limitations of the procedure. Finally, the study was concluded by identifying the change of the modal frequencies and damping of a particular bridge system in time using recursive filters.

  abstract = {Abutment behavior significantly influences the seismic response of certain bridge structures. Specifically in the case of short bridges with relatively stiff superstructures typical of highway overpasses, embankment mobilization and inelastic behavior of the soil material under high shear deformation levels dominate the response of the bridge and its column bents. This paper investigates the sensitivity of bridge seismic response with respect to three different abutment modeling approaches. The abutment modeling approaches are based on three increasing levels of complexity that attempt to capture the critical components and modes of abutment response without the need to generate continuum models of the embankment, approach, and abutment foundations. Six existing reinforced concrete bridge structures, typical of Ordinary Bridges in California, are selected for the analysis. Nonlinear models of the bridges are developed in OpenSees. Three abutment model types of increasing complexity are developed for each bridge, denoted as roller, simplified, and spring abutments. The roller model contains only single-point constraints. The spring model contains discrete representations of backfill, bearing pad, shear key, and back wall behavior. The simplified model is a compromise between the efficient roller model and the comprehensive spring model. Modal, pushover, and nonlinear dynamic time history analyses are conducted for the six bridges using the three abutment models for each bridge. Comparisons of the analysis results show major differences in mode shapes and periods, ultimate base shear strength, as well as peak displacements of the column top obtained due to dynamic excitation. The adequacy of the three abutment models used in the study to realistically represent all major resistance mechanisms and components of the abutments, including an accurate estimation of their mass, stiffness, and nonlinear hysteretic behavior, is evaluated. Recommendations for abutment modeling are made.},

  abstract = {The problem of determining linear models of structures from seismic response data is studied using ideas from the theory of system identification. The investigation employs a general formulation called the output-error approach, in which optimal estimates of the model parameters are obtained by minimizing a selected measure-of-fit between the responses of the structure and the model. The question of whether the parameters can be determined uniquely and reliably in this way is studied for a general class of linear structural models. Because earthquake records are normally available from only a small number of locations in a structure, and because of measurement noise, it is shown that it is necessary in practice to estimate parameters of the dominant modes in the records, rather than the stiffness and damping matrices. Two output-error techniques are investigated. Tests of the first, an optimal filter method, show that its advantages are offset by weaknesses which make it unsatisfactory for application to seismic response. A new technique, called the modal minimization method, is developed to overcome these difficulties. It is a reliable and efficient method to determine the optimal estimates of modal parameters for linear structural models. The modal minimization method is applied to two multi- story buildings that experienced the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. New information is obtained concerning the properties of the higher modes of the taller building and more reliable estimates of the properties of the fundamental modes of both structures are found. The time-varying character of the equivalent linear parameters is also studied for both buildings. It is shown for the two buildings examined that the optimal, time-invariant, linear models with a small number of modes can reproduce the strong-motion records much better than had been supposed from previous work using less systematic techniques.}

It is found that the “actual” abutment stiffness may be significantly different during different phases of the shaking and decreases significantly as the abutment deformation increases. The CALTRANS modeling procedure leads to a good estimate of the transverse abutment stiffness and capacity. However, this procedure may overestimate the normal abutment stiffness and capacity by a factor of over two, indicating that the assumed value of 7.7 ksf for the ultimate passive resistance of the soil, used in the CALTRANS procedure, may be too high. The AASHTO-83 and ATC-6 procedures lead to an initial estimate of the abutment stiffness that is too high in both directions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a probability model-based global sensitivity analysis (PM-GSA) framework, to compute various Sobol’ indices when only input-output data are available. The PM-GSA framework consists of two main elements, namely data extraction and probability model training. The data extraction step extracts data of the variables of interest (VoI) and quantity of interest (QoI) from an input-output data matrix. Following that, a probability model is built to approximate the joint probability density function between the VoI and QoI. The learned probability model is then used to compute various Sobol’ indices. The implementation of the PM-GSA framework is investigated through three probability models including Gaussian copula model, Gaussian mixture model, and a new Gaussian mixture copula model. The number of dimensions of the probability model in the PM-GSA framework, is independent of the number of input variables and is always N + 1 (e.g. 2 for the firstorder index), where N is the order of the Sobol’ index. In addition, the PM-GSA framework is applicable to global sensitivity analysis with not only independent input variables, but also with dependent input variables and for sets of variables. Four numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the different probability models.},

The components as well as the integrated system are verified through comparison with previous studies and measured data. The stiffness of abutments and pile foundations are evaluated by three-dimensional finite-element analysis and compared with those from previous investigations. The analytical models of abutments and foundations are combined with the structural model using the multiplatform analysis framework, UI-SimCor. The dynamic properties of the model for multiplatform analysis are compared with those evaluated from system identification techniques using recorded ground motion. Finally, response history analyses are conducted with recorded free-field ground motion. The analysis results are in very good agreement with measured response showing the promising potential of multiplatform dynamic simulation.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty in the seismic demand of a structure (referred to as the engineering demand parameter, EDP) needs to be properly characterized in performance-based earthquake engineering. Uncertainties in the ground motion and in structural properties are responsible for EDP uncertainty. In this study, sensitivity of EDPs to major uncertain variables is investigated using the ÿrst-order second-moment method for a case study building. This method is shown to be simple and e cient for estimating the sensitivity of seismic demand. The EDP uncertainty induced by each uncertain variable is used to determine which variables are most signiÿcant. Results show that the uncertainties in ground motion are more signiÿcant for global EDPs, namely peak roof acceleration and displacement, and maximum inter-storey drift ratio, than those in structural properties. Uncertainty in the intensity measure (IM) of ground motion is the dominant variable for uncertainties in local EDPs such as the curvature demand at critical cross-sections. Conditional sensitivity of global and local EDPs given IM is also estimated. It is observed that the combined e ect of uncertainties in structural properties is more signiÿcant than uncertainty in ground motion proÿle at lower IM levels, while the opposite is true at higher IM levels.

A very simple, finite element 3-D beam model for the bridge is constructed, and the rotational stiffnesses are used to model the effect of the foundations. A dynamic analysis is performed, in which the recorded translational earthquake accelerations are used as input excitation to the structure, and the predominant modal frequencies of the model are shown to compare well with the results obtained through system identification, even though simplifying assumptions were made. A sensitivity analysis is also performed on the rotational boundary springs to study how much they affect the dynamic response of the structure. In further studies, these procedures could be used to gain more insight into the dynamic effects of soil-structure interaction and should prove to be particularly useful for preliminary designs of structures.},

The performance of the computational model is evaluated by comparing the computed responses with the responses recorded at the bridge site during the 1979 Imperial Valley and 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquakes. Amongst the recorded earthquake events at the bridge site, these two events caused the strongest shaking. The comparison shows that the 3D model is potentially an effective tool for detailed analysis of a full bridge system including foundation soils, pile foundations, embankments, supporting columns, and the bridge structure itself in a unified system without relying on any ancillary models such as Winkler springs. Additional response parameters such as displacements, rockings, and bending moments are also evaluated although none of these was measured during the seismic events.},

Modeling of the soil-structure interaction (SSI) in the system is simplified by replacing the pile foundations, abutments, and soil with sets of independent equivalent linear springs and dashpots at the base of the superstructure. The main objective of the paper is to examine how well the substructuring method simulates the seismic response of a bridge system. The baseline data required for the evaluation process is derived from analyzing a fully-coupled continuum bridge model, already validated for the instrumented two-span Meloland Road Overpass. The same bridge system is also simulated using the substructuring method. The results from both approaches are compared, and it is shown that the differences between them can be significant. The substructuring method consistently overestimates the pier base shear forces and bending moments and the pier top deflections. Moreover, the spectral response of the bridge structure is mispredicted. The analyses are repeated for a three-span bridge system subjected to several ground motions, leading to a similar observation as before. Hence, the current state of practice for simulating seismic SSI in bridges using the substructure model is shown to be too simplified to capture the major mechanisms involved in SSI.},

  abstract = {Strong-motion earthquake data obtained on the Meloland Road Overpass during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake are used to examine the suitability of simple models for representing the transverse and vertical stiffnesses of the abutment-embankment systems on highway bridges. Information on the seismic responses of both the abutment-embankment systems and the bridge superstructure is obtained by applying techniques of system identification to the strong-motion records. Analytic models, as developed in a companion paper, that account for the transverse and vertical stiffness characteristics of the bridge abutment systems are used to calculate equivalent abutment stiffnesses for incorporation into finite element models of the Meloland bridge. Predicted earthquake responses of these models are compared to the measured seismic responses and to optimal modal parameters obtained from the system identifications. Results of the various analyses show that the simplified models work quite well in simulating the stiffnesses of the abutments and are able to predict with good accuracy the frequencies and mode shapes of the first symmetric transverse and first symmetric vertical modes of the bridge. These two modes are the major contributors to the seismic response of this bridge. Use of the abutment stiffness models also provides insight into the damping ratios that have been observed for the bridge response.},

  abstract = {A two-part analytical model is developed to assist in seismic response analysis of highway bridges that have abutments supported on earth embankments. In the first part of the model, an expression is developed for identification of the fundamental transverse frequency of the earth embankment. In the second part, two simple equivalent springs are used to represent the transverse and vertical stiffness of a monolithic abutment system. The springs are based on linear elastic planestrain analysis of a typical trapezoidal-shaped embankment cross section. The spring stiffnesses are related to the cross-sectional dimensions and the soil properties of the earth embankment, which supports the bridge abutments. These stiffnesses can be incorporated into a detailed dynamic model of the superstructure as the equivalent stiffnesses of the bridge abutments. The frequency and the translational stiffnesses predicted by the model are in good agreement with results from a more complicated analytic theory and from finite element analysis of the abutment soil system. A companion paper illustrates an application of the model and provides comparisons to recorded earthquake responses.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic procedure for the seismic response analysis of highway overcrossings. The study employs an elementary stick model and a more sophisticated ÿnite element formulation to compute response quantities. All dynamic sti nesses of approach embankments and pile groups are approximated with frequency-independent springs and dashpots that have been established elsewhere. A real eigenvalue analysis conÿrms the one-to-one correspondence between modal characteristics obtained with the three-dimensional ÿnite element solutions and the result of the simpler stick-model idealization. A complex eigenvalue analysis yields modal damping values in the ÿrst six modes of interest and shows that modal damping ratios assume values much higher than those used by Caltrans. The validity of the proposed method is examined by comparing the computed time response quantities with records from the Meloland Road and Painter Street overcrossings located in southern and northern California, respectively. The proposed procedure allows for inexpensive parametric analysis that examines the importance of considering soil–structure interaction at the end abutments and centre bent. Results and recommendations presented by past investigations are revisited and integrated in comprehensive tables that improve our understanding of the dynamic characteristics and behaviour of freeway overcrossings. The study concludes with a step-by-step methodology that allows for a simple, yet dependable dynamic analysis of freeway overcrossings, that involves a stick model and frequency-independent springs and dashpots.
